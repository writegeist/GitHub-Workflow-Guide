# Basic Commands

Git provides several commands to help you manage your project and track changes effectively. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

### git init
This command initializes a new Git repository in the current folder. Use it when starting a new project.

`git init`

### git add
1. Adds files to the staging area, preparing them for a commit. You can add a specific file or all changes: `git add`

2. Add a specific file: `git add filename.txt`

3. Add all changes: `git add .`

### git commit
Saves your changes to the repository's history. It's like creating a checkpoint in your project: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`

### git status
Shows the current status of your repository, including staged, modified, and untracked files: `git status`

### git log
Displays a history of commits in your repository. This is useful for reviewing changes: ` git log`

### git clone
Copies an existing repository to your local machine. Use this when collaborating on a project: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`

### git push
Uploads your committed changes to a remote repository (like GitHub). It makes your updates visible to collaborators: `git push origin branch-name`

### git pull
Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to your local repository. Keeps your work up-to-date: `git pull origin branch-name`

These basic commands can help you get started with Git workflows. Practice them by creating a simple repository and making changes. Once you're comfortable, you can explore more advanced commands and features!
