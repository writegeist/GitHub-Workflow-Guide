## Getting Started with Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes to files and collaborate with others. Follow these steps to get started:

### Step 1: Install Git
Git can be installed on most operating systems. Visit the official Git website [here](https://git-scm.com/) and download the installer for your platform. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.

### Step 2: Configure Git
After installing Git, you'll need to configure it with your username and email address. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

'git config --global user.name "Your Name" git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"'

This information will be included in your commits and help identify changes made by you.

### Step 3: Verify Installation
To verify that Git is installed correctly, run the following command:

'git --version'

If Git is installed, this command displays the installed version.

### Step 4: Create Your First Repository
A repository is where your project files are stored. To create a repository, run these commands:

1. Navigate to the folder you want to turn into a Git repository:

'cd path/to/your/folder'

2. Initialize the repository:

'git init'

Now, the folder is a Git repository, and you can start tracking changes.
